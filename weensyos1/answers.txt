Response to Exercise 1:

When the process that called sys_getpid() eventually runs again, the call to
sys_getpid() will have returned the correct value because schedule() simply
iterates through the array of all processes, executing processes that are
runnable. When it schedule() reaches the process that called sys_getpid(), it
will call run() on this process, which will in turn return the correct pid.
