# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We chose to implement concurrency by forking processes.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

Buffer Overflow Attack
The first attack implemented is in task_download. We attempt to overflow their
buffer by asking for an extra long filename (TASKBUFSIZE - 11) to account for 
the spaces, "GET", and "OSP2P". If the peer only copies the string, without 
checking for an overflow, they will encounter a segmentation fault.

Upload data forever
The second attack is implemented in task_upload. We attempt to send the peer
endless amounts of useless data (using an infinite while loop). The peer
may think that the data is from the valid file, allowing us to fill up their
disk with "Muahahaha!"

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none
