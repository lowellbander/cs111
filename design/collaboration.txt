We did parallel/parrot programming when possible. 
Because we vastly different schedules, one of us would work on the code and push
to gitHub while the other person would be sleeping. 
We would pick up where the other left off, either debugging or begin adding the 
next feature. Almost all of the sections of code were either co-written 
or debugged by both of us.
