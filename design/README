For our design project, we improved upon lab 1c by allowing the user to limit
the amount of parallelism to at most N subprocesses, where N is a parameter that
can be set by an argument to the shell. The new usage is as follows:

usage: ./timetrash [-pt] SCRIPT-FILE [N-THREADS]

A simple script that might be tested might look something like:

echo chimichanga      ; echo finished 1
echo alpha > a.txt    ; echo finished 2 
echo pseudo > a.txt   ; echo finished 3
echo beta > b.txt     ; echo finished 4
echo rho              ; echo finished 5
echo gamma > a.txt    ; echo finished 6
echo epsilon > b.txt  ; echo finished 7
echo chi              ; echo finished 8
echo omega > c.txt    ; echo finished 9
